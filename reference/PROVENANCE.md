[Top Down Operator Precedence](http://crockford.com/javascript/tdop/tdop.html)
is Douglas Crockford's introduction to
[the ideas introduced](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512931)
by Vaughn Pratt in 1973.

The JavaScript source code files,
[tokens.js](http://crockford.com/javascript/tdop/tokens.js) and
[parse.js](http://crockford.com/javascript/tdop/parse.js),
are from Crockford's
[demonstration](http://crockford.com/javascript/tdop/index.html).


I found another good writeup on the topic
at [Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing Made Easy](

by Bob Nystrom.
